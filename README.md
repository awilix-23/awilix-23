> hi there, i’m awilix !

## ✨ about

i like writing random, useless tools and learning how computers *really* work.

currently working on:

- 🐚 bash scripting & cli tools
- 🕸️ web stuff (a little html/css/js)
- 💾 low-level programming in C
- 📘 reading *Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Principles in C*

## 🛠️ projects

here’s some stuff i’m tinkering with:

- solutions to the C book i'm reading: [`dsa_c`](https://github.com/awilix-23/dsa_c) 
- my setup: [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/awilix-23/dotfiles)
- odin project stuff: [`library`](https://github.com/awilix-23/Library)
